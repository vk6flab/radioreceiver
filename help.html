    <h1 class="title">Radio Receiver</h1>
    <p class="what">
      An application to listen to radio transmissions from your browser using a
      cheap RTL-SDR stick.
    </p>

    <div id="toc"></div>

    <h1 id="what_is_this">What is Radio Receiver</h1>
    <p>
      Radio Receiver is an HTML5 webpage that uses an RTL-SDR USB stick to
      receive and digitize radio signals. Then, it demodulates those signals on
      your computer and plays the resulting audio through your computer's
      speakers or headphones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most RTL-SDR sticks let you receive signals in any frequency between 30
      and 1700 MHz. This includes interesting radio bands like FM radio, marine
      radio, air band (airplanes and airports), weather radio, amateur radio,
      police and other emergency services, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also be able to listen to frequencies below 30 MHz using an
      upconverter or some sticks' “direct sampling mode”. These frequencies
      include AM radio, shortwave radio, HF amateur radio, and numbers stations,
      among others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radio Receiver can demodulate stereo FM, AM, narrowband FM, USB, LSB, and
      CW. It has adjustable bandwidth filters so you can also listen to Morse
      code transmissions or challenging, distant stations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radio Receiver was written by
      <a href="https://jacobo.tarrio.org/">Jacobo Tarrío</a>, and its source is
      <a href="https://github.com/jtarrio/radioreceiver">available on GitHub</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h1 id="compatibility">Compatible hardware and software</h1>
    <p>
      Radio Receiver needs to run in a browser that supports the HTML5 USB API.
      Generally, this means a Chromium based-browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera) on a
      computer or on an Android device.
      <script>
        if (navigator.usb)
          document.write(
            "You are reading this in a compatible browser, " +
              "so you can try Radio Receiver in this one."
          );
        else
          document.write(
            "You are reading this in an incompatible browser, " +
              "so you will need to try a different one to use Radio Receiver."
          );
      </script>
    </p>
    <p>
      Radio Receiver was written to work with an RTL-2832U-based receiver with a
      R820 or R828 tuner chip (or compatible). In particular, the RTL-SDR Blog
      V3 and V4 sticks are supported, but old R820 or R860-based sticks should
      work too.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may need to configure your computer to use an RTL-SDR stick if you use
      Windows or Linux (MacOS, Android, and Chrome OS usually work out of the
      box.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For Windows, use the program
        <a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie/">Zadig</a> to install a WinUSB driver.
      </li>

      <li>
        For Linux, you may need to
        <a href="https://ranous.wordpress.com/rtl-sdr4linux/"
          >configure your system</a
        >
        to get raw USB access to the stick.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="what_to_know">Some things you need to know</h1>

    <h2 id="how_sdr_works">How SDR works</h2>
    <p>
      Traditionally, radios were built entirely out of hardware components such
      as oscillators, inductors, capacitors, transistors, etc., that were
      selected and combined to receive and demodulate a particular type of
      signal. Therefore, each type of signal required its own hardware, and
      modifying a radio to receive a different signal could be hard or even
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern approach to radio is “Software-Defined Radio” (SDR), in which
      the hardware only receives and digitizes the signals, and then a computer
      processes them with special software. SDR systems are flexible (changing
      the signals they can receive can be as simple as changing their software)
      and cheap, because the same hardware designs can be used for many
      different types of radio signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your RTL-SDR stick was designed as a European Digital TV receiver. It
      contains a microprocessor that demodulates radio signals, extracts a video
      stream, and sends it to your computer. However, it can be made to send the
      signals to your computer instead of decoding them. Radio Receiver will
      then receive those signals and demodulate them in your browser.
    </p>

    <h2 id="frequency">Frequency, bandwidth, and sample rate</h2>
    <p>
      Your RTL-SDR stick works by tuning into a radio frequency, receiving radio
      signals around that frequency, digitizing them, and sending them to your
      computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radio waves are electromagnetic fields that oscillate. The rate at which
      they oscillate is called the “frequency”, which is measured in Hertz
      (cycles per second.) Radio frequencies usually are in the thousands or
      millions of Hertz, so we often use kilohertz (kHz) for thousands of Hertz,
      or megahertz (MHz) for millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you tune a receiver, you adjust it to receive a frequency. RTL-SDR
      sticks don't only receive signals in the exact frequency they are tuned
      into; instead they receive a “band” of frequencies. The difference between
      the lowest and highest frequencies in that band is the “bandwidth”.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Digitizing” the signals in that frequency band means turning them into a
      stream of numbers (digital “samples”) that can be processed by a program
      running on a computer. The number of samples sent per second is the
      “sample rate”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bandwidth and the sample rate are tied together: 1 sample per second
      corresponds to 1 hertz of bandwidth. Therefore, more bandwidth lets you
      “see” more signals at once but requires more computing power to deal with
      a higher sample rate. Conversely, if you reduce the sample rate to use
      less computing power, you will receive a smaller bandwidth.
    </p>

    <h2 id="modulation">Modulation</h2>
    <p>
      Signals need to be “modulated” to be transmitted through the radio. This
      modulation is a scheme to modify the radio waves according to the content
      of the signal. The receiver can then “demodulate” the received radio waves
      to extract the original signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many modulation schemes. You have probably heard of FM and AM,
      which stand for “frequency modulation” and “amplitude modulation”, but
      there are many others. Radio Receiver can demodulate commercial FM and AM,
      and also narrowband FM (used in 2-way radios and weather radio), USB and
      LSB (used in amateur radio), and CW (used for Morse code.)
    </p>

    <h2 id="decibels">Decibels</h2>
    <p>
      The power of a radio signal is indicated in decibels (dB). Decibels are
      not units of measure like meters, pounds, liters, or acres: there is no
      “how big is a decibel.” Instead, they are units of comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      When engineers compare the power of two signals, they don't care if one is
      a little bit stronger than the other. They want to know if it's twice as
      strong, 10 times as strong, five million times as strong, one billionth
      the strength, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decibels let us avoid having to use such big numbers by letting us know
      how many times we would have to multiply (or divide) our reference signal
      to be as strong as the signal we're measuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an exact formula, but normal people cannot do logarithms in their
      heads, so there is also a rule of thumb: you start with 0 dB; every time
      you double the power, you add 3 dB, and every time you multiply it by 10,
      you add 10 dB. Conversely, if you divide by 2 or 10, you subtract 3 or 10
      dB.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a signal twice as strong as the reference is 3 dB; 10 times as strong,
      10 dB; one thousand times as strong, 30 dB (multiply by 10 three times); 5
      million times as strong, 67 dB (multiply by 10 seven times then divide by
      2), and one billionth is -90 dB (divide by 10 nine times.)
    </p>

    <h2 id="upconverters">Upconverters and direct sampling</h2>
    <p>
      RTL-SDR sticks are designed to receive signals between 30 and 1700 MHz.
      However, there are many interesting signals below 30 MHz (AM radio,
      shortwave radio, lots of amateur radio, etc.) so people have come up with
      several ways to receive those frequencies with RTL-SDR.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to do it is by using an “upconverter”: a device that raises the
      frequency of signals to put them in the range that RTL-SDR sticks can
      receive. Some sticks have an integrated upconverter, while other
      upconverters are external devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way is to use “direct sampling mode”: a modification to the sticks
      by which the tuner chip is bypassed so the sampler chip receives the radio
      signals directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radio Receiver supports sticks that have direct sampling mode and the
      RTL-SDR Blog V4 with its internal upconverter. It also supports external
      upconverters, with an option to use the bias T, if present, to turn the
      upconverter on and off automatically depending on the tuned frequency.
    </p>

    <h1 id="how_to_use">How to use Radio Receiver</h1>

    <h2 id="main_display">The main display</h2>
    <p>
      The main Radio Receiver display appears below, showing a few simulated
      radio signals to better illustrate how it works.
    </p>

    <rr-demo-spectrum></rr-demo-spectrum>

    <p>
      The main parts of this display are, from top to bottom: the spectrum
      scope, the waterfall, and the bottom bar.
    </p>

    <h3 id="spectrum_scope">The spectrum scope</h3>
    <p>
      The spectrum scope represents the frequency band that Radio Receiver is
      tuned into. The lowest frequency is in the left and the highest frequency
      is in the right, and the scale at the top shows which frequency
      corresponds to each part of the scope.
    </p>

    <rr-demo-scope></rr-demo-scope>

    <p>
      The yellow line “dancing” in the scope shows how much signal power is
      present on each frequency: the higher it goes, the more power there is. On
      the left, a decibel scale lets you gauge the amount of power. 0 dB is the
      maximum power that Radio Receiver can process, so all the numbers in the
      scale are negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the figure above, you can see some strong signals on 93.5, 93.9, and
      94.3 MHz, and a weak one on 94.1.
    </p>

    <h3>The waterfall</h3>
    <p>
      The spectrum scope shows you the signals that are being received right
      now, but the waterfall lets you see what signals were received in the
      past.
    </p>

    <rr-demo-waterfall></rr-demo-waterfall>

    <p>
      The waterfall scrolls down slowly, showing more recent signals at the top
      and less recent ones on the bottom. On each line, each pixel corresponds
      to a frequency and takes a brighter color if there is a strong signal in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the waterfall, you can see if there are regular transmissions on
      neighboring frequencies, how wide they are, how often they repeat, and
      more important information. With enough practice, you can even tell what
      type of transmission it is!
    </p>

    <h3>The bottom bar</h3>
    <p>
      The bottom bar lets you adjust the decibel range for the spectrum scope
      and waterfall, and also lets you zoom in and out of a particular frequency
      range.
    </p>

    <rr-demo-bottombar></rr-demo-bottombar>

    <p>
      The
      <script>
        const isHighBottombar =
          document.getElementsByTagName("rr-demo-bottombar")[0].offsetHeight >
          24;
        if (isHighBottombar) document.write("top half");
        else document.write("left side");
      </script>
      contains the decibel range adjustment controls, which consists of two
      numbers separated by a “rainbow”. You can change the numbers directly, or
      you can drag the two sliders that appear on either side of the rainbow. As
      you do so, you will see changes in the decibel scale in the spectrum
      scope, and the new lines in the waterfall will change their colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <script>
        if (isHighBottombar) document.write("left side of the bottom half");
        else document.write("middle of the bar");
      </script>
      contains the zoom controls, which contain two “magnifier glass” buttons
      with a number in between. The “zoom in“ button
      <rr-demo-button name="zoom-in"></rr-demo-button> increases the
      magnification level, while the “zoom out” button
      <rr-demo-button name="zoom-out"></rr-demo-button> decreases it. The
      current magnification level is shown between the buttons; you can edit it
      directly if you prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <script>
        if (isHighBottombar) document.write("right side of the bottom half");
        else document.write("right side of the bar");
      </script>
      contains a scrollbar that you can use to move around the spectrum when you
      are zoomed in. This works like a classic Windows scrollbar: click on the
      arrow buttons <rr-demo-button name="scroll-left"></rr-demo-button
      ><rr-demo-button name="scroll-right"></rr-demo-button> to scroll a little,
      click between the slider and the button to scroll one page, and drag the
      slider from side to side to scroll freely.
    </p>

    <h2 id="main_controls">The main controls</h2>
    <p>
      The main Radio Receiver controls are shown below. They let you tune into a
      different frequency, change the signal demodulation parameters, and adjust
      the gain for your receiver.
    </p>

    <rr-demo-controls></rr-demo-controls>

    <h3>Play/stop/settings</h3>

    <p>
      Press the “play“ button <rr-demo-button name="play"></rr-demo-button> to
      start listening to the radio. When the radio is playing, the “play” button
      becomes the “stop” button <rr-demo-button name="stop"></rr-demo-button>,
      which you can press to stop listening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Press the “presets” button
      <rr-demo-button name="presets"></rr-demo-button> to open the
      <a href="#presets">presets window</a>, and the “settings” button
      <rr-demo-button name="settings"></rr-demo-button> to open the
      <a href="#settings">settings window</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Tuning</h3>
    <p>
      You have two frequencies to play with in Radio Receiver: the “center
      frequency” and the “tuning frequency”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The center frequency determines the frequency band that you'll receive
      with your RTL-SDR stick. It is always the frequency in the center of your
      spectrum scope and waterfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tuning frequency is the frequency within the received band that
      contains the signal you want to listen to.
    </p>
    <p>
      To change either frequency, type it in the corresponding box. On the
      right, you can select the unit you'd like to use (Hz, kHz, or MHz); this
      unit is also used in the spectrum display.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, you can change the center or tuning frequency without changing
      the other, as long as the tuning frequency is within the frequency band in
      the spectrum scope. If it would fall outside of the band, the frequency
      you didn't change will be modified so that you can use the frequency you
      selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: if your center frequency is 93.9 with a 1 MHz-wide band and
      you set the tuning frequency to 94.1, the center frequency will stay at
      93.9. However, if you change the tuning frequency to 88.3, the center
      frequency will also be changed to 88.3 so that your selected tuning
      frequency works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “tuning step” is most useful with the display controls, so it will be
      described with them.
    </p>

    <h3>Modulation</h3>
    <p>
      The next line lets you select a modulation scheme for the signal. You can
      choose between wideband FM (WBFM, used in commercial radio), narrowband FM
      (NBFM), AM, upper sideband (USB), lower sideband (LSB), and continuous
      wave (CW). You need to match the modulation scheme to the signal you are
      receiving; otherwise, you'll only hear noise or gibberish.
    </p>

    <rr-demo-controls scheme="AM"></rr-demo-controls>

    <p>
      You can also select a bandwidth for all schemes except WBFM. You generally
      need to match the bandwidth to the received signal, but you may sometimes
      need to use a reduced bandwidth if there are interfering signals near the
      one you are interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squelch control mutes the radio automatically when there isn't a
      signal. This lets you monitor a channel that's used infrequently without
      having to hear noise all the time. By setting the value of the squelch
      control, you decide how strong the signal needs to be to unmute your
      radio.
    </p>
    <p>
      For WBFM, you can enable and disable stereo reception. When stereo
      reception is enabled, the stereo indicator will turn green whenever a
      stereo signal is detected, or grey otherwise.
    </p>

    <h3>Tuner gain</h3>
    <p>
      Your RTL-SDR stick has an amplification circuit to boost the power of
      received signals. Its amplification level (“gain”) can be controlled
      automatically (“auto gain”) or manually through the main controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      (When the RTL-SDR stick is in “direct sampling mode”, only automatic gain
      control is available.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very useful to control the gain manually, but it has to be done
      judiciously. There is such a thing as “too much gain”. The recommendation
      is to have enough gain that you can receive your signal well, but not
      enough to raise the noise floor. This is how you do it:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, uncheck “auto gain” and move the gain slider all the way to the
      left to set it to the minimum value. Adjust the decibel range in the
      spectrum scope so that the yellow line appears at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, increase the gain slowly while you watch the spectrum scope. You
      should see some signals rise while the rest of the line stays at the
      bottom. At some point, the whole yellow line will start to go up; that's
      when you stop increasing the gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, you'll have the best signal-to-noise ratio with the minimum
      amount of noise. If you kept increasing the gain, the signal level would
      go up but the noise would also rise with it. At some point, the noise
      would be so loud that it would swamp the demodulation algorithms, making
      the demodulated audio sound worse.
    </p>

    <h2 id="display_controls">The display controls</h2>
    <p>
      There is a second set of controls available on the spectrum display, which
      you can manipulate by clicking and dragging with the mouse or touch
      screen.
    </p>

    <rr-demo-highlight></rr-demo-highlight>

    <h3>Changing the tuned frequency</h3>

    <p>
      You can see a yellow vertical line surrounded by a highlighted area on top
      of the current tuned frequency. The yellow line indicates the frequency,
      and the white area indicates the modulation bandwidth.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change the tuned frequency by dragging the yellow line to the left
      and right with your mouse, or with your finger on touch screens.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also modify the bandwidth by dragging the edge of the white area
      to the left or right with your mouse or finger. (This does not work with
      WBFM because it uses a fixed bandwidth.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to change the tuned frequency is by clicking or tapping on a
      point on the screen that corresponds to the frequency you wish to tune
      into.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you change the frequency by clicking or dragging, the frequency is
      always changed in increments of the “tuning step”, which can be set in the
      main controls window. This makes it easier to change frequencies
      accurately.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing the center frequency</h3>
    <p>
      You can change the center frequency by clicking and dragging the waterfall
      from side to side. The center frequency will change in increments of the
      selected frequency unit (Hz, kHz, or MHz.)
    </p>

    <h2 id="presets">The presets window</h2>

    <rr-demo-presets></rr-demo-presets>

    <p>
      You can open the presets window by clicking the presets button
      <rr-demo-button name="presets"></rr-demo-button> in the main controls
      window.
    </p>

    <p>
      This window shows a list of saved stations and frequencies with their
      names and modulation scheme. Click on any of them to switch to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use the “add” button <rr-demo-button name="add"></rr-demo-button> to add
      the currently-tuned station to the presets list. Click on the “edit”
      <rr-demo-icon name="edit"></rr-demo-icon> and “delete”
      <rr-demo-icon name="delete"></rr-demo-icon> icons in each row to edit and

      Click on the table headings (“Name”, “Frequency”, and “Mode”) to sort the
      table by the values in that column. If you click again in the same
      heading, the ordering will flip between first-to-last and last-to-first.

      You can resize the presets window by dragging the lines on the right and
      bottom edges of the window, or the double arrow on the bottom right
      corner. In this way, you can have it always open where it doesn't get in
      the way.

      You can open the settings window by clicking the “settings” button
      <rr-demo-button name="settings"></rr-demo-button> in the main controls
      window.

      The “sample rate” setting lets you change the RTL-SDR stick's sample rate;
      that is the number of samples it captures per second. Note that, as you
      change the sample rate, the bandwidth that is visible in the spectrum
      display also changes (see the “<a href="#frequency"
        >frequency, bandwidth, and sample rate</a
      >” section for more information.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The “PPM correction” setting lets you make adjustments if your RTL-SDR
      stick is not exactly on frequency. By changing the value (which represents
      the frequency drift, in parts per million), you can make the RTL-SDR stick
      tune a little bit higher or lower until it's just right.
    </p>

    <p>
      The “FFT size” setting lets you change the resolution of the spectrum
      display. Higher values result in more detailed spectra, at the cost of
      more processing power.

      The “bias T” is a circuit that exists in some RTL-SDR sticks, which can
      power an external device through the antenna connection. When you check
      this setting, you enable the bias T in your stick, if it has one.
    </p>

      The “0-29MHz method” setting lets you select what Radio Receiver will do
      when you try to tune into a frequency lower than 28.8 MHz:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The “default method” setting tries to use the stick's internal
        upconverter, if it has one.
      </li>
      <li>
        The “direct sampling” method enables the stick's direct sampling mode,
        if available. You can select the variant of direct sampling that your
        stick uses through the “direct sampling channel” setting.
      </li>
      <li>
        The “external upconverter” method makes the stick tune into the
        upconverter's frequency range. The “use bias T for upconverter” lets you
        turn the upconverter on automatically if it's powered by your stick's
        bias T.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      (Note that the “direct sampling” setting has no effect on RTL-SDR Blog V4
      sticks. Those will always use the default method or the external
      upconverter.)
